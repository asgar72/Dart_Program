/*String Concatenation
You can combine one String with another string. This is called concatenation.
In Dart, you can use the + operator or use interpolation to concatenate the String.
Interpolation makes it easy to read and understand the code.*/

void main() {
  String firstName = "Asgar";
  String lastName = "Abbas";
  print("Using +, Full Name is "+firstName +" "+lastName +".");
  print("Using interpolation, full Name is $firstName $lastName.");
}
